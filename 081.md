# Lack of reentrancy guard for `withdraw` and `redeem` in all contracts

## Summary

In WithdrawPeriphery.sol, [withdrawToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L113) and [redeemToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L133) functions are used to transfer the user funds.

Similarly, junior and senior vault also can have these kind of functionalities for withdraw and redeem.

## Vulnerability Detail

As these two functions are interacting with user account, if user account smart contract, then both function can be reentered.

Refer following places in three different  contract like withdrawpherepry, junior vault and senior vault.
