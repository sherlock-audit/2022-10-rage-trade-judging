# Unchecked return value of external AAVE call of IPool interface

## Summary
Unchecked return value of external AAVE call of IPool interface in some functions of `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol`. It is dangerous when a pool is working abnormal, i.e., liquidity drained, anomalous price fluctuation.

## Vulnerability Detail
In function `_executeRepay` and `_executeWithdraw` of `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol`, `state.pool.repay(token, amount, VARIABLE_INTEREST_MODE, address(this))` and `state.pool.withdraw(token, amount, receiver)` are called without checking its return value.

According to the specification of `aave\core-v3\contracts\interfaces\IPool.sol`, `repay` and `withdraw` return the final amount. When `repay` and `withdraw` return zero or an abnormal amount number without calling `revert`, the fund would be lost.

## Impact
Unchecked return value of external call to pool will suffer losses under abnormal circumstances.
