# WithdrawPeriphery#_convertToToken slippage control is broken for any token other than USDC

## Summary

WithdrawPeriphery allows the user to redeem junior share vaults to any token available on GMX, applying a fixed slippage threshold to all redeems. The slippage calculation always returns the number of tokens to 6 decimals. This works fine for USDC but for other tokens like WETH or WBTC that are 18 decimals the slippage protection is completely ineffective and can lead to loss of funds for users that are withdrawing.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function _convertToToken(address token, address receiver) internal returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // this value should be whatever glp is received by calling withdraw/redeem to junior vault
        uint256 outputGlp = fsGlp.balanceOf(address(this));

        // using min price of glp because giving in glp
        uint256 glpPrice = _getGlpPrice(false);

        // using max price of token because taking token out of gmx
        uint256 tokenPrice = gmxVault.getMaxPrice(token);

        // apply slippage threshold on top of estimated output amount
        uint256 minTokenOut = outputGlp.mulDiv(glpPrice * (MAX_BPS - slippageThreshold), tokenPrice * MAX_BPS);

        // will revert if atleast minTokenOut is not received
        amountOut = rewardRouter.unstakeAndRedeemGlp(address(token), outputGlp, minTokenOut, receiver);
    }

WithdrawPeriphery allows the user to redeem junior share vaults to any token available on GMX. To prevent users from losing large amounts of value to MEV the contract applies a fixed percentage slippage. minToken out is returned to 6 decimals regardless of the token being requested. This works for tokens with 6 decimals like USDC, but is completely ineffective for the majority of tokens that aren't.  

## Impact

Users withdrawing tokens other than USDC can suffer huge loss of funds due to virtually no slippage protection

## Recommendation

Adjust minTokenOut to match the decimals of the token:

        uint256 minTokenOut = outputGlp.mulDiv(glpPrice * (MAX_BPS - slippageThreshold), tokenPrice * MAX_BPS);
    +   minTokenOut = minTokenOut * 10 ** (token.decimals() - 6);
