# Collect modules can fail on zero amount transfers if assets fee is set to zero

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
assets fee can be zero, while collect modules do attempt to send it in such a case anyway as there is no check in place. Some ERC20 tokens do not allow zero-value transfers, reverting such attempts.

This way, a combination of zero assets fee and such a token set as a collection fee currency will revert any collect operations, rendering collect functionality unavailable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the treasury fee amount and do a transfer only when it is positive.

Now:

```solidity
 IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
```

To be:

```solidity
if (assets > 0) {
	 IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
```
