# `DnGmxSeniorVault` share minting can be broken by early depositor.

## Summary
An early minter can break the `DnGmxSeniorVault` share price, resulting in future depositors losing `aUSDC` upon withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail

`DnGmxSeniorVault` allows users to deposit USDC that can serve as collateral on Aave, while earning the Aave Supply APR as well as a portion of ETH Rewards from GMX based on the utilisation ratio.

Users can deposit by calling `DnGmxSeniorVault.deposit()`. The function calls `ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit()`, which computes the amount of shares to be minted, and transfers the `aUSDC` to the vault.

The issue is that because of how `convertToShares` computes the amount of shares to be minted, an early minter can inflate the share price and steal `aUSDC` from future depositors:

- Alice calls `DnGmxSeniorVault.deposit(1)`, depositing `1` unit of `aUsdc` in the vault. She receives `1` share.
- Alice transfers `1e6 - 1` `aUSDC` to the vault using the `ERC20.transfer()` method.
- Bob calls `DnGmxSeniorVault.deposit(1.999999e6)`.
- Because of Alice's transfer, `aUsdc.balanceOf(vault) = 1e6`. `1 * 1.9999 e6 / 1e6` rounds to `1`: Bob receives `1` share: the same amount as Alice.
- Alice calls `DnGmxSeniorVault.withdraw` to redeem her shares: because she owns half of the shares, she will receive ~`1.5 * 1e6` `aUSDC`, effectively stealing approximately `0.5 * 1e6` `aUSDC` from Bob.

## Impact
Early minters can essentially steal `aUSDC` from future minters

## Recommendation
Consider sending the first 1000 shares to the address 0, a mitigation used in [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124).
