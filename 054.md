# There is a risk that the `feeBps` variable is accidentally initialized to 0 and platform loses money

## Summary

With the `feeBps` and `withdrawFeeBps`  in the `DnGmxJuniorVault.sol` file, the initial rate are set with an argument of type uint256, but there is no check that prevents this rate from starting with 0.

There is a risk that the `feeBps` and `withdrawFeeBps`  variable are accidentally initialized to 0

Starting `feeBps` and `withdrawFeeBps`  with 0 are an administrative decision, but since there is no information about this in the documentation and NatSpec comments during the audit, we can assume that it will not be 0

In addition, it is a strong belief that it will not be 0, as it is an issue that will affect the platform revenues.


## Vulnerability Detail

Although the value initialized with 0 by mistake or forgetting can be changed later by `onlyOwner`, in the first place it can be exploited by users and cause huge amount  usage

There is a critical difference between updating the fee to 0 afterwards and forgetting it to be 0 at the beginning.


## Impact

The  `withdrawFeeBps`  value is initially set in the `setAdminParams` function, critically only the `MAX_BPS` check is done, this is correct so that the user is not exploited, but the platform bypasses the other important check and does not check for an accidental initialization of 0 ;

The same error exists in the `setFeeParams` function where the `feeBps` value is then set;

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an if block to the function ;
