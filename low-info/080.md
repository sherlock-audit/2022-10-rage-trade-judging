# wethConversionThreshold should has a reasonable limit

## Summary

`wethConversionThreshold` is the threshold amount for weth fees to be compounded into sGlp. If `wethConversionThreshold` is too high, the harvested weth from GLP could stuck in DnGmxJuniorVault. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.harvestFees()`, it harvests weth from GLP. then it would convert junior tranche share of weth into glp if  `wethHarvested > state.wethConversionThreshold`. Also it would converts convert senior tranche share of weth into usdc and deposit into AAVE if `_seniorVaultWethRewards > state.wethConversionThreshold`.

Therefore, if `state.wethConversionThreshold` is too high. those weth could stuck in the DnGmxJuniorVault for a very long time.

## Impact

A bad `wethConversionThreshold` make those ETH rewards from GLP stuck in DnGmxJuniorVault for a very long time. Then, the Junior Tranche is hard to provide an extra boost in yield by auto-compounding ETH rewards into GLP & restaking earned esGMX & multiplier points. Also, the senior tranche cannot earn a fraction of ETH rewards from GLP based on the amount of USDC lent to Jr. Tranche before the `_seniorVaultWethRewards` reach unreasonable `wethConversionThreshold`.

## Recommendation

Add a reasonable limit for `wethConversionThreshold` in `DnGmxJuniorVault.setThresholds`
