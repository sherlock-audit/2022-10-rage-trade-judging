# Deprecated Chainlink oracle function

## Summary

Under the hood, the Aave V3 Oracle uses Chainlink's `latestAnswer` which is deprecated: https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/price-feeds/api-reference/#latestanswer

A deprecated function may stop functioning 

## Vulnerability Detail

Aave Oracle's `getAssetPrice` function is called twice

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L326

Aave Oracle's `getAssetPrice` calls the deprecated function:
https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol#L112

Chainlink documents this function as deprecated:
https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/price-feeds/api-reference/#latestanswer

This issue was mentioned in a past Aave audit but no action was taken
https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/issues/292

## Impact

If this deprecated function stops functioning and returns a constant stale price, it will not activate Aave's fallback oracle. In this case, the price shown in the Rage Finance frontend will not match the actual price. Users may perform actions without realizing the real price of the assets involved, potentially causing loss of user value and diminishing the reputation of involved parties.

## Code Snippet

Aave Oracle's `getAssetPrice` function is called twice

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `latestRoundData` function to get the price instead of Aave's Oracle which uses a deprecated function: https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/price-feeds/api-reference/#latestrounddata
