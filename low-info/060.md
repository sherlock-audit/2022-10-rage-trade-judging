# Wrong min amount calculation in WithdrawPeriphery.sol

## Summary
`WithdrawPeriphery` uses the function `_getGlpPrice` to determine the minimum amount of token a user should receive as a result of the swap on Gmx (slippage protection). Unfortunately the number of decimals takes only in account the case when a user wants to withdraw to USDT or USDC (6 decimals). If a user wants to withdraw to a token with 18 decimals such as WBTC or WETH, an abnormally low value is used as a minAmount.
