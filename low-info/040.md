# Unchecked return value of external tranfer call

## Summary
The return value of `IERC20(token).transfer` is not checked. Actually, some tokens do not revert when failure and just return false state.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager._executeOperationToken`,  `IERC20(token).transfer(address(state.balancerVault), amountWithPremium)` is executed without check its return. When some tokens do not revert when failure and just return false,  it won't act as the comments said "transfer token amount borrowed with premium back to balancer pool", and then, the pool would lost these assets.

In `DnGmxBatchingManager.depositToken`, IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),amount)  is the same.

## Impact
Unchecked return value would possibly cause loss of assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the return value of transfer. If return false, then revert the execution.
