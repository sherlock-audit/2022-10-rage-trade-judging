# Use `safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom` consistently instead of `transfer/transferFrom`

## Summary

Replace `transferFrom()` with `safeTransferFrom()` since `_tokenIn` can be any `ERC20` token implementation. If `transferFrom()` does not return a value (e.g., USDT), the transaction reverts because of a decoding error.

## Vulnerability Detail

Replace `transferFrom()` with `safeTransferFrom()` since `_tokenIn` can be any `ERC20` token implementation. If `transferFrom()` does not return a value (e.g., USDT), the transaction reverts because of a decoding error. Revert without error.

## Impact

It is good to add a require() statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in the contract.
