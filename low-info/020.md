# Anyone can trigger a transfer of protocol fees

## Summary

Transfer of protocol fee is not protected. The attacker can trigger the transfer whatever the parameters are set to. It could be problematic if the protocol owner made a mistake with the fee recipient address.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can call withdrawFees() method on DnGmxJuniorVault leading to unwanted transfer of funds to whoever was the wrong recipient.

The issue is here, the method should be protected: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxJuniorVault.sol#L306

## Impact

This can lead to loss of funds or transfer to an unexpected address if the protocol owner did not select the right fee recipient.

## Tool used

Manual Review & Test Framework

## Recommendation

Add a require testing that msg.sender is actually the fee recipient. This would limit the damages because it would require that the owner of the wrong address be aware that some funds are waiting for him. In the meantime, the protocol owner could still update the fee recipient to target the right account instead.
