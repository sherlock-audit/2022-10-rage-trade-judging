# Compatibility issue: imported contracts from aave are not the latest

## Summary
The project is developed using solidity 0.8.9.  The imported contracts from `aave/periphery-v3` and `aave/core-v3` has the lastest version of 0..8.10.

## Vulnerability Detail
That indicates that `aave/periphery-v3` and `aave/core-v3` has update their contracts and functions since the last time rage project included them. It is better to update the solidity version and imported contracts to avoid possible compatibility issues.

## Impact
Without using the latest version may lead to some compatibility issues.
