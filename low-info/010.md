# `safeTransferFrom()` function should be used instead of `transferFrom()` function

## Summary
- `safeTransferFrom()` function should be used instead of `transferFrom()` function

## Vulnerability Detail
- `transferFrom()` function is used in the following lines.
   - However, `transferFrom()`function does not return whether transferring tokens is successful or not. 

## Impact
- This vulnerability lead to unexpected-behavior that a transaction could continue to proceed even if transferring token using `transferFrom()`function fail. As a result, for example, unexpected-values may be stored even if transferring tokens fail.

## Code Snippet
- `transferFrom()` is used in several parts in this repo:

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Should use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of using `transferFrom()`
   - The benefit of using `safeTransferFrom()` is that the boolean return value is `automatically asserted` . If a token returns false on transfer or any other operation, a contract using `safeTransferFrom()` will `revert`. This is the easiest way to check whether transferring tokens is successful or not.
