# if the owner is resetting the fee recipient   an attacker can frontrun the  the resetting and  the new fee recipient will not get the fees

## Summary
if the owner is resetting the fee recipient   an attacker can front-run the resetting and  the new fee recipient will not get the fees 
## Vulnerability Detail
if the owner is resetting the fee recipient   an attacker can front-run the resetting and  the new fee recipient will not get the fees 
because there is no access control on the` withdrawFees()` function anyone can call it maybe if the fee recipient has a deal with the actor who initiated `withdrawFees()`.The problem also is that the owner changes the recipient but why is it fair they miss out on the fees  on tx before
## Impact
the new recipient doesn't get  fees 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
    function withdrawFees() external {
        uint256 amount = state.protocolFee;
        state.protocolFee = 0;
        state.weth.transfer(state.feeRecipient, amount);
        emit FeesWithdrawn(amount);
    }
```
