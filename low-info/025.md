# Use of transferFrom() for arbitrary ERC20 tokens is not recommended

## Summary
There are plenty of non-compliant ERC20 tokens and some do not revert on failure such as ZRX. Instead, they return false and requires to be handled by the calling contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`depositToken()` uses `transferFrom()` to receive tokens from users. Failure of this function is not caught by the protocol if token is non-compliant.

## Impact
Tokens are then staked based on amount that is transferred. If contract is holding any of such tokens, this function can be called by anyone to stake tokens that do not belong to them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransferFrom()` instead.
