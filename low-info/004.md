# Non-Standard ERC20 Transfer Safety

## Summary

There are multiple tokens deployed that do not comply with the ERC20 correctly. The use of these is not handled safely in the contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

`DnGmxBatchingManager`

The batching manager [transfers ERC20 tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L187) into the contract via a `depositToken()` function. This implementation does not check for the success of the transfer and continues to convert to GLP.

## Impact

- If there are tokens of the same type already in the contract and the ERC20 transfer fails, these will be used to stake in GLP instead of the tokens of the calling contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider implementing the SafeERC20 wrapper from OpenZeppelin: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom-contract-IERC20-address-address-uint256-
