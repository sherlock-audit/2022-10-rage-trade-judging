# Inconsistent Storage Gaps

## Summary

Storage gaps are used with upgradable contracts to provide safety in new deployments. They allow for new storage variables to be added without overwriting existing state. There is an inconsistent number of gaps between the vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`DnGmxBatchingManager`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L46)

There are [100 slots ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L46) reserved in this implementation. In the [junior](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxJuniorVault.sol#L60) vault there are 50, and there are 50 in the [senior](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L63) vault.

## Impact

- This lack of consistency in the contract implementation could lead to confusion in upgrades and overwrites of state storage.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256[100] private _gaps;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Have a consistent approach to assigning storage slots with upgradable contracts to avoid confusion and state collisions during deployments
