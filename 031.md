# The function redeem is unprotected

## Summary

In WithdrawPeriphery.sol `redeemToken` is not protected, allowing stealing of user funds under conditions.

https://github.com/clems4ever/2022-10-rage-trade-clems4ever/blob/d435f586667c6312cfadecd3f8c850a89907c5d9/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L133

## Vulnerability Detail
When a legitimate user desires to interact with WithdrawPeriphery, he has to first approve tokens to the contract. Unfortunately once he has approved his tokens to the contract an attacker can use `redeemToken` to steal his funds because `from` and `receiver` are not checked.

## Impact
Theft of user funds

## Code Snippet
See the test labeled `2.unprotected_redeem`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not leave the `from` parameter open. Use msg.sender
