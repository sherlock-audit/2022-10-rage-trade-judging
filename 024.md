# `executeBatchDeposit()` is missing access control

## Summary
`executeBatchDeposit()` is callable by anyone which `_unpause()` deposits. 15 minutes cool down set by the protocol can be bypassed due to this.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calling `executeBatchDeposit()` will `unpause()` deposit as it is required for batch deposit, but this can be called at anytime by anyone. 

## Impact
Pause state that is being used to prevent deposits can be bypassed.
