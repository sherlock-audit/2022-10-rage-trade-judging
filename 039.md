# WithdrawPeriphery uses incorrect value for MAX_BPS which will allow much higher slippage than intended

## Summary

WithdrawPeriphery accidentally uses an incorrect value for MAX_BPS which will allow for much higher slippage than intended. 

## Vulnerability Detail

    uint256 internal constant MAX_BPS = 1000;

BPS is typically 10,000 and using 1000 is inconsistent with the rest of the ecosystem contracts and tests. The result is that slippage values will be 10x higher than intended.

## Impact

Unexpected slippage resulting in loss of user funds, likely due to MEV

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Correct MAX_BPS:

    -   uint256 internal constant MAX_BPS = 1000;
    +   uint256 internal constant MAX_BPS = 10_000;
