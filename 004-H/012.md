# There is no input validation on `withdrawToken()` so an attacker can input any address as `from` and cause loss of funds

## Summary
There is no input validation on `withdrawToken()` so an attacker can input any address as `from` and cause a loss of funds 
## Vulnerability Detail
an attacker can supply an address as `from` parameter and cause loss of funds because its not msg.sender that is withdrawing and then the `receiver` is the attacker 
## Impact
loss of funds 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
      dnGmxJuniorVault.withdraw(sGlpAmount, address(this), from);

        amountOut = _convertToToken(token, receiver);

        emit TokenWithdrawn(from, receiver, token, sGlpAmount, amountOut);
    }
