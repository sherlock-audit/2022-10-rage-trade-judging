# Noop rebalance under a particular condition

## Summary

In `DnGmxJuniorVault.sol`:
If only one of BTC/ETH price changes (not both), only one side needs to be rebalanced in `_rebalanceBorrow()`, and this causes the rebalance to fail because of a mistake in the condition

## Vulnerability Detail

Here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/libraries/DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#L402
if condition is true then the flashloan amounts are computed as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/libraries/DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#L409

which will trivially assign zero amounts for the flash loan in either case.

## Impact
The rebalance operation is not conducted properly (and cannot be forced by admin), which means the protocol can lose funds since it is not delta neutral anymore.

## Recommendation
change the condition to
```solidity
if (btcAssetAmount != 0)
```
