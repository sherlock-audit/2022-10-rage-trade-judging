# Fees can be burnt by 3 party actor if state.feeRecipient is set to 0 in DnGmxJuniorVault

## Summary
Fees can be burnt by 3 party actor if state.feeRecipient is set to 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
`DnGmxJuniorVault.withdrawFees` is a function that is allowed to call by anyone in order to [send accumulated fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxJuniorVault.sol#L306-L311) to the `state.feeRecipient` param.

`DnGmxJuniorVault.setFeeParams` function allows owner to provide `state.feeRecipient` param. But it doesn't check if address is not 0. Also while initializing [there is no](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxJuniorVault.sol#L88-L122) `state.feeRecipient` setting. That means that after the contract is created and initialized `state.feeRecipient` param is address(0).

As the result when `DnGmxJuniorVault.withdrawFees` function is called then all fees will be burnt to address(0). And what is more dangerous is that the function can be called by anyone. While protocol owners will notice the mistake and will try to change fee recipient someone can already burn their fees.

Similar problem has `DnGmxJuniorVault.claimVestedGmx`, but in this case it's only [callable by owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxJuniorVault.sol#L336), so in case if owner will see that no fee recipient is provided he has time to do that.
## Impact
Protocol fees can be burnt because of lack of input checking.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setFeeParams(uint16 _feeBps, address _feeRecipient) external onlyOwner {
        if (state.feeRecipient != _feeRecipient) {
            state.feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
        } else revert InvalidFeeRecipient();


        if (_feeBps > 3000) revert InvalidFeeBps();
        state.feeBps = _feeBps;


        emit FeeParamsUpdated(_feeBps, _feeRecipient);
    }


    /// @notice withdraw accumulated WETH fees
    function withdrawFees() external {
        uint256 amount = state.protocolFee;
        state.protocolFee = 0;
        state.weth.transfer(state.feeRecipient, amount);
        emit FeesWithdrawn(amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Check that fee recipient is not address(0) in `DnGmxJuniorVault.withdrawFees` and `DnGmxJuniorVault.claimVestedGmx` functions.
