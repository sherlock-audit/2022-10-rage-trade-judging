# Front-runnable DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#updateBorrowCap

## Summary

The borrower can front run the updateBorrowCap and borrow more than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function updateBorrowCap is vulnerable to front-running.

```solidity
  function updateBorrowCap(address borrowerAddress, uint256 cap) external onlyOwner {
      if (borrowerAddress != address(dnGmxJuniorVault) && borrowerAddress != address(leveragePool))
          revert InvalidBorrowerAddress();

      if (IBorrower(borrowerAddress).getUsdcBorrowed() >= cap) revert InvalidCapUpdate();

      borrowCaps[borrowerAddress] = cap;
      // give allowance to borrower to pull whenever required
      aUsdc.approve(borrowerAddress, cap);

      emit BorrowCapUpdated(borrowerAddress, cap);
  }
```

the borrower can use borrow to front-run the updateBorrowCap.

```solidity
  function borrow(uint256 amount) external onlyBorrower {
      // revert on invalid borrow amount
      if (amount == 0 || amount > availableBorrow(msg.sender)) revert InvalidBorrowAmount();

      // lazily harvest fees (harvest would return early if not enough rewards accrued)
      dnGmxJuniorVault.harvestFees();

      // transfers aUsdc to borrower
      // but doesn't reduce totalAssets of vault since borrwed amounts are factored in
      aUsdc.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

the onlyBorrower modifier restrict that only the dnGmxJuniorVault contract can call this function so far, how can we trigger the dnGmxJuniorVault to borrow from the senior vault?

The dnGmxJuniorVault call  DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#borrow in DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#rebalanceHedge

```solidity
// rebalance the unhedged glp (increase/decrease basis the capped optimal token hedges)
_rebalanceUnhedgedGlp(state, optimalUncappedEthBorrow, optimalEthBorrow);

if (availableBorrow > 0) {
    // borrow whatever is available since required > available
    state.dnGmxSeniorVault.borrow(availableBorrow);
}
} else {
//No unhedged glp remaining so just pass same value in capped and uncapped (should convert back any ausdc back to sglp)
_rebalanceUnhedgedGlp(state, optimalEthBorrow, optimalEthBorrow);

// Take from LB Vault
state.dnGmxSeniorVault.borrow(targetDnGmxSeniorVaultAmount - currentDnGmxSeniorVaultAmount);
}
```

this function DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#rebalanceHedge is called in the beforeWithdraw and afterDeposit hook in the junior Vault.

```solidity
  function beforeWithdraw(
      uint256 assets,
      uint256,
      address
  ) internal override {
      (uint256 currentBtc, uint256 currentEth) = state.getCurrentBorrows();

      //rebalance of hedge based on assets after withdraw (before withdraw assets - withdrawn assets)
      state.rebalanceHedge(currentBtc, currentEth, totalAssets() - assets, false);
  }

  function afterDeposit(
      uint256,
      uint256,
      address
  ) internal override {
      if (totalAssets() > state.depositCap) revert DepositCapExceeded();
      (uint256 currentBtc, uint256 currentEth) = state.getCurrentBorrows();

      //rebalance of hedge based on assets after deposit (after deposit assets)
      state.rebalanceHedge(currentBtc, currentEth, totalAssets(), false);
  }
```

Consider this case, 

the admin owner wants to update the updateBorrowCap, 

the old borrow cap is 100, 

the admin wants to update the borrow to 50

A user detect this transaction. 

He frontrun the updateBorrowCap, he call the deposit in Junior vault, which trigger the afterDeposit hook, which borrow from the senior vault.
and borrow 100 amount.

The transaction landed, the borrow cap is adjusted to 50 amount.

The user backrun the updateBorrowCap, he call the withdraw in Junior vault, which trigger the beforeWithdrawal hook, which borrow another 50 amount from the senior vualt.

## Impact

User can borrow more than the admin intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of setting the given amount, one can reduce from the current approval. By doing so, it checks whether the previous approval is spend.
