# If the `renounceOwnership` authorization is used, the project becomes unavailable

## Summary

`onlyOwner` has another secret import (from `OwnableUpgradeable.sol`) privilege: `renounceOwnership()`
They can use this authority whenever he wants, there is no restriction.
If he uses this authority, the very important functions detailed below will not be available, updated or added.


## Vulnerability Detail

We see the use of Openzeppelin in `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` in many contracts and owners can `renounceOwnership()` like this project, which is sometimes a positive as it reduces the risk of rugpull but the situation is a bit different here, Owner is constantly needed
(For example Pause/ Unpause) , so security risk is high

```
Proof of Concept
1 - OnlyOwner does renounceOwnership() based on her authority in the OwnableUpgradeable.sol contract
2 - The project must be 'pause' due to a fatal error or compromised users' vaults
3 - Unfortunately this cannot be done

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of directly importing the `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` contract, a project-specific Ownable.sol should be used by removing the `renounceOwnership()` function, which is the subject of the above-mentioned potential problem.
