# The _totalSupply can be miscalculated in ERC4626Upgradeable.sol

## Summary
The _totalSupply can be miscalculated when an EOA with depolyed contract accidentally reenters deposit and mint function of ERC4626Upgradeable.sol twice or more.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is great that the implementation of deposit and mint function of ERC4626Upgradeable.sol transfer assets before minting or ERC777s could reenter. However, the total supply <code>_totalSupply</code> of the Vault's underlying asset token is calculated after deposit or mint. <code>_totalSupply</code> would be calculated wrong when  a depolyed asset contract with callback reenters deposit and mint twice or more. 

Let's take the reentrancy of two times for example:

1.  An user approves and calls `ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit` to deposit his assets to the Vault;
2.  However, In `ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit`, `IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets)`, the `asset` is implemented with a callback in its `ERC721TokenReceiver` to `ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit`;
3.  Then, 2 assets of the user may transfer to the Vault, but `_mint(receiver, shares)` in `ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit` only counts 1 time of shares for the user with miscalculated _totalSupply.

The calling path is as follows:

<code>
in ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit(uint256,address) (dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/ERC4626/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#59-71):

	External calls:

	- IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),assets) (dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/ERC4626/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#64)
	
	State variables written after the call(s):

	- _mint(receiver,shares) (dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/ERC4626/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#66)

	- _totalSupply += amount (manual-export/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#269)

in ERC4626Upgradeable.mint(uint256,address) (dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/ERC4626/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#84-95):

	External calls:

	- IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),assets) (dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/ERC4626/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#88)

	State variables written after the call(s):

	- _mint(receiver,shares) (dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/ERC4626/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#90)

	- _totalSupply += amount (manual-export/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#269)
</code>

## Impact
If an `asset` is implemented with a callback in its `ERC721TokenReceiver` to `ERC4626Upgradeable.deposit` or `ERC4626Upgradeable.mint`, the shares of user would be miscalculated with wrong `_totalSupply`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To implement another function independently scans, calculates and updates the shares of users of the Vaultâ€™s underlying asset token.
