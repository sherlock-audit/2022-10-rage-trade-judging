# WithdrawPeriphery.sol : Transfer the fund from `fsGlp` before calling the `withdrawToken` and `redeemToken`

## Summary
During the `withdrawToken` and `redeemToken` call, whatever the fund the `fsGlp` has, all are used to send to the reciever based on some pre-condition. Refer the [function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L147-L161)where the fund is sent to receiver.  

Both `withdrawToken` and `redeemToken` is called without checking the balance of `fsGlp` If there are any fund in `fsGlp`, that also will be sent to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

User can call either [withdrawToken ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L113)or [redeemToken ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L133)to withdraw their fund.

Inside the [_convertToToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L147) function, whatever the fund the [fsGlp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L149), all are considered to sent the caller.

The fact here is, the `fsGlp` could already have some fund. This can happen 
When any of the transaction fails.
When the `fsGlp` received fund from anybody else or even from somebody from protocol who  sent to this contract by mistake.

## Impact

If `fsGlp` has any fund prior to callling the [withdrawToken ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L113)and [redeemToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/periphery/WithdrawPeriphery.sol#L133), then the user will take away all of then along with their fund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that prior to calling the `_convertToToken` inside the `withdrawToken` and `redeemToken`, follow the below procedure,

Check if `fsGlp` has any fund, if so, transfer it to admin account or treasury.

Sample is show for `withdrawToken` similarly follow the same for `redeemToken` also

    function withdrawToken(
        address from,
        address token,
        address receiver,
        uint256 sGlpAmount
    ) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // user has approved periphery to use junior vault shares
        dnGmxJuniorVault.withdraw(sGlpAmount, address(this), from);

        {
         add implementation to transfer fund to treasury from `fsGlp` if it has any valid fund.    --------------> Recommendation
        }

        amountOut = _convertToToken(token, receiver);


        emit TokenWithdrawn(from, receiver, token, sGlpAmount, amountOut);
    }
