# Anyone (any external users) can mint `any amount` of `vault shares` - because of lack of access control modifier on `mint()` function

## Summary
- Anyone (any external users) can mint `any amount` of `vault shares` - because of lack of access control modifier on `mint()` function

## Vulnerability Detail
- Lack of `access control modifier` on `mint()` function that allow any external users to be able to mint `any amount` of `vault shares` .

## Impact
- There is no access control modifier on `mint()` function in the DnGmxJuniorVault.sol and DnGmxSeniorVault.sol.
   - As a result, any external users can mint `any amount` of `vault shares`
     - This vulnerability lead to an exploit that give large vault shares to malicious attackers without proper efforts.

## Code Snippet
- There is no access control modifier on `mint()` function in the DnGmxJuniorVault.sol

- There is no access control modifier on `mint()` function in the DnGmxSeniorVault.sol.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
- It should add an access control modifier to `mint()` function in order to that `only privileged-users` can access this function by using access control libraries in @openzeppelin/contracts (such as onlyOwner, onlyRole, etc) for example:
   - onlyOwner by Ownable.sol：https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#ownership-and-ownable
   - onlyRole by AccessControl.sol：https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control#role-based-access-control
