# Wrong price calculation in DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol

## Summary
in `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol` at line:647:
`usdcPrice` should be on denominator and `MAX_PRECISION` on numerator
(cf pricing in Vault: uint256 redemptionAmount = _usdgAmount.mul(PRICE_PRECISION).div(price);)

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In the case usdcPrice is higher than 1$ (which already happened in reasonable market circumstances). 
Min amount expected will be higher than swap result under 0% slippage conditions. 
The call will revert, which will delay rebalances until usdcPrice comes back to 1$, 
and causing potential loss to the protocol.
