# Uniswap V3 conversion swap path is incorrectly hardcoded in DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol

## Summary

Uniswap V3 swap path is hardcoded.

## Vulnerability Detail

When receiving a token from the balancer flash loan, the contract needs to perform a trade on Uniswap via two function.

```solidity
  ///@notice swaps usdc into token
  ///@param state set of all state variables of vault
  ///@param token address of token
  ///@param tokenAmount token amount to be bought
  ///@param maxUsdcAmount maximum amount of usdc that can be sold
  ///@return usdcPaid amount of usdc paid for swap
  ///@return tokensReceived amount of tokens received on swap
  function _swapUSDC(
      State storage state,
      address token,
      uint256 tokenAmount,
      uint256 maxUsdcAmount
  ) internal returns (uint256 usdcPaid, uint256 tokensReceived) {
      ISwapRouter swapRouter = state.swapRouter;

      bytes memory path = token == address(state.weth) ? USDC_TO_WETH(state) : USDC_TO_WBTC(state);
```

We swap swaps usdc into token.

and

```solidity
    ///@notice swaps token into usdc
    ///@param state set of all state variables of vault
    ///@param token address of token
    ///@param tokenAmount token amount to be sold
    ///@param minUsdcAmount minimum amount of usdc required
    ///@return usdcReceived amount of usdc received on swap
    ///@return tokensUsed amount of tokens paid for swap
    function _swapToken(
        State storage state,
        address token,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        uint256 minUsdcAmount
    ) internal returns (uint256 usdcReceived, uint256 tokensUsed) {
        ISwapRouter swapRouter = state.swapRouter;

        // path of the token swap
        bytes memory path = token == address(state.weth) ? WETH_TO_USDC(state) : WBTC_TO_USDC(state);
```

We swap token into usdc. now if we look into how WETH_TO_USDC related path construction implemented:

```solidity
    /* solhint-disable func-name-mixedcase */
    ///@notice returns usdc to weth swap path
    ///@param state set of all state variables of vault
    ///@return the path bytes
    function USDC_TO_WETH(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
    }

    ///@notice returns usdc to wbtc swap path
    ///@param state set of all state variables of vault
    ///@return the path bytes
    function USDC_TO_WBTC(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.wbtc, uint24(3000), state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
    }

    ///@notice returns weth to usdc swap path
    ///@param state set of all state variables of vault
    ///@return the path bytes
    function WETH_TO_USDC(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
    }

    ///@notice returns wbtc to usdc swap path
    ///@param state set of all state variables of vault
    ///@return the path bytes
    function WBTC_TO_USDC(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.wbtc, uint24(3000), state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
    }
```

clearly we can see the path is hardcoded:

in the current implementation: 

USDC_TO_WETH == WETH_TO_USDC,

both use:

```solidity
return abi.encodePacked(state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
```

both only trying to construct the path from WETH to USDC.

USDT_TO_WBTC == WBTC_TO_USDC

both use:

```solidity
return abi.encodePacked(state.wbtc, uint24(3000), state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
```

both only trying to construct the path from WBTC to USDC.

**Another point:**

the hardcoded path may not be the optimal path:

If we see the WETH related path, 

https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2

the WBTC/ETH pool that has 0.05% fee has much higher trading volume than the WBTC / ETH pool that charges 0.3% fee,

but in the code, the path also assume the WBTC / ETH pool charges 0.3% fee, given the trading volume, the WBTC / ETH pool that charges 0.05% can be a better option.

## Impact

The code has issue constructing path from USDC to WETH or USDC to WBTC.
The hardcoded may not have the optimal liquidity / fee charged when conducting the trade.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project at least change from 

```solidity
    function USDC_TO_WBTC(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.wbtc, uint24(3000), state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
    }
```

to

```solidity
    function USDC_TO_WBTC(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.usdc, uint24(500), state.weth, uint24(500), state.wbtc);
    }
```

and

```solidity
    function USDC_TO_WETH(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.weth, uint24(500), state.usdc);
    }
```

to

```solidity
    function USDC_TO_WETH(State storage state) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodePacked(state.usdc, uint24(500), state.weth);
    }
```

and it is better to preview the output of the different conversion paths and then use the path that has the optimal liquidity instead of hardcoding the path.
