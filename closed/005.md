# Third Parties May Unpause Contract

## Summary

Open Zeppelin's `Pausable` library enables contract administrators to prevent the operation of specific functions. This helps to protect users from loses by restricting further deposits into a set of contracts that are experiencing security/operational issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`DnGmxBatchingManager.executeBatchDeposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L240)

This function may be called by anybody. There is logic inside that will unpause the contracts if the contracts are currently paused.

Elsewhere in the contracts the ability to unpause is restricted to specific users with a modifier.

## Impact

Users of the contracts can incur further loses in the following set of events:

- An attacker has exploited a vulnerability in the contract
- The administrator has paused the contract to prevent users depositing and incurring further loses
- The attacker may unpause the contract to attract and exploit more users

## Code Snippet

- Example of where `_unpause()` is protected:

```solidity
function unpauseDeposit() external onlyKeeper {
    _unpause();
}
```

- Example of where anybody may call `_unpause()`:

```solidity
function executeBatchDeposit() external {
    // If the deposit is paused then unpause on execute batch deposit
    if (paused()) _unpause();
```

## Tool used

## Recommendation

- Protect this function by implementing a modifier
