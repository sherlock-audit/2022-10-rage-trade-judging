# Attacker can manipulate the pricePerShare to profit from future users' deposits

## Summary
By manipulating and inflating the pricePerShare to a super high value, the attacker can cause all future depositors to lose a significant portion of their deposits to the attacker due to precision loss.
## Vulnerability Detail

For example, in the DnGmxSeniorVault contract, a malicious early user can deposit() with 1 wei of USDC as the first depositor of the LToken, and get 1 wei of shares.

Then the attacker can send 10000e18  of aUSDC and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 ( from (10000e18 ) / 1) .

As a result, the future user who deposits 9999e18 will only receive 0 (from 9999e18 * 1 / 10000e18) of shares token.

They will immediately lose all of their deposits.

## Impact
The attacker can profit from future users' deposits. While the late users will lose part of their funds to the attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send part of the initial mints as a permanent reserve to the DAO/treasury/deployer so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
