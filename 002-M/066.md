# First depositor of sGLP token can break share calculations

## Summary

The first depositor into any new Vault can buy a small number of shares and then send a large amount of the underlying asset to the contract which will break the share calculation and make the shares extremely expensive for the subsequent depositors. This is a common attack vector in most of the shares based liquidity pool contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

supply == 0 ? shares

Given the sGLP token vault with DAI as the underlying asset,

1. Alice (attacker) will deposit initial liquidity of 1 wei of DAI via `ERC4626.deposit`
2. Alice receives 1 share of the protocol
3. Alice proceeds to send a marge large number, ie 10 ** 18 of DAI directly to the sGLP address to artificially inflate the asset balance without minting new shares.
4. The asset balance is not 10 ** 18 + 1 wei of DAI, the vault share price is not extremely high
5. Bob, unbeknownst to him, deposits 100 ** 18 of DAI but receives 0 shares

## Impact

Subsequent depositors will not be able to get equivalent shares from depositing their underlying asset

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimum amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter or follow Uniswap V2 which mints 10,000 share first to balance liquidity.
