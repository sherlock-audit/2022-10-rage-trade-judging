# Share price manipulation by first depositor is possible on DnGmxJuniorVault and DnGmxSeniorVault

## Summary
Share price manipulation by first depositor is possible on DnGmxJuniorVault and DnGmxSeniorVault. As result next depositors might lose part of their deposited assets, while attacker will get bigger amount of assets than he deposited. 
## Vulnerability Detail
DnGmxSeniorVault is created and no one deposited yet. 
Alice buys first share for minimum amount of USDC using `DnGmxSeniorVault.deposit` function. Price of 1 share becomes 1.
Then Alice donates a big amount `aliceAmount` of aave aUSDC token to DnGmxSeniorVault directly(simple ERC20 transfer). Now we have `1` amount of shares and `aliceAmount + 1` of deposited asset controlled by DnGmxSeniorVault. This is how totalAssets are checked.

```solidity
    function totalAssets() public view override(IERC4626, ERC4626Upgradeable) returns (uint256 amount) {
        amount = aUsdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        amount += totalUsdcBorrowed();
    }
```

Then Bob deposits arbitrary amount of assets, that is `bobAmount > aliceAmount`.
As result Bob receives `bobAmount / (aliceAmount + 1)` shares because of rounding here. Bob loses part of `bobAmount % aliceAmount` sent to the vault, alice controls more assets in vault now.
## Impact
Next depositors can lost their money, while first user will take all of them or some part.

## Recommendation
Add limit for the first deposit to be a big amount.
