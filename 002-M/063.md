# Early user share manipulation with 1 wei

## Summary

A user who deposits to Junior/Senior vault first can steal part of everybody's tokens by sending small amounts of tokens to the system. This attack is possible because you enable depositing a small amount of tokens. It can also work when everyone withdraws, and total share supply becomes 0.

This is a a well known attack vector for almost all shares based liquidity pool contracts. See here for more iterations about this issue: [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-08-sentiment-judging/blob/main/004-H/1-report.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-08-sentiment-judging/blob/main/004-H/1-report.md)

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious early user can `deposit()` with `1 wei` of `asset` token as the first depositor of the LToken, and get `1 wei` of shares.

Then the attacker can send `10000e18 - 1` of `asset` tokens and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 ( from `(1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1`) .

As a result, the future user who deposits `19999e18` will only receive `1 wei` (from `19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18`) of shares token.

They will immediately lose `9999e18` or half of their deposits if they `redeem()` right after the `deposit()`.

## Impact

Early 1 wei attacker can steal other user's funds.

## Code Snippet
In `ERC4626Upgradeable`

```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply(); // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

    return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply, totalAssets());
}
```

and in `DnGmxJuniorVault`

```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view override(IERC4626, ERC4626Upgradeable) returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply(); // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

    return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply, state.totalAssets(true));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send a portion of the initial mints to the `state.feeRecipient` so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
- Alternatively mint initial liquidity to 0x00 address, as in Uniswap V2: [Uniswap/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L121](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L121)
    
    ```solidity
    if (_totalSupply == 0) {
        liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0.mul(amount1)).sub(MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
       _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
    }
    ```
