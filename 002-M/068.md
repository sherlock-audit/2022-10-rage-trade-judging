# Steal deposit fund in ERC4626 vault by exchange rate manipulation

## Summary

Although the `ERC4626` contract has check for `require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");`, the rounding down error can still be used to steal new user deposit. Part of the new deposit could be stolen. The attacker may monitor the pool activities to catch the steal opportunities.

The easiest mitigation is send a small share to address(0) for new vault.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `assets` per `shares` deposit could manipulated, because the `_totalAssets()` can be inflated to any value by influence `state.dnUsdcDeposited`. `state.dnUsdcDeposited` can be artificially influenced by calling `receiveFlashLoan()` -> `_executeOperationToken()`, when use the input parameters `repayDebt` as false, and `usdcAmount` also provided by the user.


An attacker will be the following:
1. watch the mempool to monitor new ERC4626 vault deployment.
2. make sure to be the first to `deposit()` in the pool.
3. when a new user tries to call `deposit()`, the attacker will front run it, transfer some fund into the vault, not through `deposit()` function in vault, but call `receiveFlashLoan()` with `usdcAmount` desired, in this way the `totalAssets` / `shares` ratio will be inflated. 
4. after the manipulation, the new user will only get 1 wei of share, but the fund corresponding to the share will be half of the deposit amount.
5. attacker call `withdraw()/redeem()`, steal part of the user's deposit fund.

Take the asset USDC, the numbers for each steps would be:
1. watch mempool
2. attacker being the first deposit: 99 wei USDC, 99 wei share
3. user tries to deposit 1,000 USDC (1e21), so call `deposit(1e21)`. The attacker will front run to `receiveFlashLoan()` with (500 * 99) USDC to increase `state.dnUsdcDeposited`. Now the vault has (495e20 + 99) USDC as `totalAssets`, 99 share, 1 share inflated to (5e20 + 1) USDC.
4. assets per share will be inflated.
The call to `previewDeposit(1e21)` -> `convertToShares(1e21)` will calculate `assets.mulDivDown(supply, totalAssets())`, the result is 1e21 * 1 / (5e20 + 1), just less than 2, so round down to 1. So
the new user gets 1 share, the pool has (505e20 + 99) USDC, almost 50,500 USDC.
5. attacker withdraws the 99 share for about 49,995 USDC. The user end up with around 505 USDC, almost half is lost.

If the attacker does not have 49,500 USDC upfront, the steal still works, just the profit a little lower.

Although the condition of empty vault for this pattern seems not easy meet, if do it on purpose, the malicious user can still abuse the system in certain circumstances, in which the vector conditions are not so hard to meet. For instance in the following ways:
- monitor the new pool events and mempool, make sure to mint the first share as soon as possible.
- target the relatively small pools, by providing large supply to lower the return. As a result, other users might lose incentives to continue stay in the pool due to the low return and gradually withdraw their shares. Over a longer period, the attacker might have opportunities when the vault is empty again.

## Impact

Part of the deposit fund from the 2nd user will be stolen by the attacker for new vault. Potentially the attacker can intentionally monitor the pool activities to find steal conditions.


## Code Snippet

The `receiveFlashLoan()` function in `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol` can be called by anyone:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/libraries/DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#L736-L742

Which will call `_executeOperationToken()` at the end:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/libraries/DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#L788-L805

In `_executeOperationToken()`, the desired `usdcAmount` can be added to `state.dnUsdcDeposited`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/libraries/DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol#L935-L944

Then, `_totalAssets()` will use the artificially influenced `state.dnUsdcDeposited` to calculate the `assets` per `shares` deposit:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- easiest and most important:
When first `mint()` in the vault, sent a small amount to address(0), then the attacker won't be able to benefit from this behavior. 
- in addition:
Add some access control on `receiveFlashLoan()` function in `DnGmxJuniorVaultManager.sol`.
