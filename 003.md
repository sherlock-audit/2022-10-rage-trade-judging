# Two Storage Gap Implementations In Same Contract

## Summary

Storage gaps provide state safety against collisions on upgrades. In one contract there are two implementations.

## Vulnerability Detail

`DnGmxBatchingManager`

[Line 46](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L46) implements a storage gap of 100 slots. [Line 74](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L74) implements a further 50.

## Impact

- Multiple implementations can create confusion during upgrades and lead to state being overwritten.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256[100] private _gaps;
```

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gaps2;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Be explicit with a single implementation to avoid confusion and collisions at a later upgrade time.
