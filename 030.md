## Summary

In WithdrawPeriphery.sol `withdrawToken` is not protected, allowing stealing of user funds under conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a legitimate user desires to interact with WithdrawPeriphery, he has to first approve tokens to the contract. Unfortunately once he has approved his tokens to the contract an attacker can use withdraw to steal his funds because `from` and `receiver` are not checked.

## Impact
Theft of user funds

## Code Snippet
See the test labeled `1.unprotected_withdraw`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not leave from open. Use msg.sender
