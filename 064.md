# CALL() SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD OF TRANSFER() ON AN ADDRESS PAYABLE

## Summary
CALL() SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD OF TRANSFER() ON AN ADDRESS PAYABLE  
## Vulnerability Detail


The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.
Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.
Whenever the user either fails to implement the payable fallback function or cumulative gas cost of the function sequence invoked on a native token transfer exceeds 2300 gas consumption limit the native tokens sent end up undelivered and the corresponding user funds return functionality will fail each time.
## Impact 
The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use call() to send eth , re-entrancy has been accounted for in all functions that reference Solidity's transfer() . This has been done by using a re-entrancy guard, therefore, we can rely on msg.sender.call.value(amount)` or using the OpenZeppelin Address.sendValue library
