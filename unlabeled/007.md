Owner can set the feeRecipient to unavailable address, e.g. 0 by mistake. The next call to `withdrawFees` loses all the accumulated fees from contract. Even if the owner quickly recognizes the mistake, malicious actor can frontrun next call to `setFeeParams` with `withdrawFees`. 

## Remediation

Consider setting the `feeRecipient` in two steps like in following example: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3620 .
