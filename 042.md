# WithdrawPeriphery: withdrawToken/redeemToken allows users to withdraw other users' approved shares

## Summary
WithdrawPeriphery contract's withdrawToken/redeemToken functions allow users to use other users' addresses as from, which allows malicious users to use shares that other users have approved to WithdrawPeriphery to withdraw assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
Before using the withdrawToken/redeemToken function of the WithdrawPeriphery contract, the user is required to approve the share of dnGmxJuniorVault to the WithdrawPeriphery contract, but in the withdrawToken/redeemToken function, there is no requirement that from == msg.sender, which allows malicious users to use shares approved by other users to withdraw assets.
Consider the following scenario,
User A wants to withdraw assets using the WithdrawPeriphery.withdrawToken function, he approves 1000 shares to the WithdrawPeriphery contract.
User B observes the call of the dnGmxJuniorVault.approve function, and user B calls the WithdrawPeriphery.withdrawToken function, where from is user A and receiver is user B.
Eventually, User B withdraws the asset using User A's 1000 shares.
## Impact
malicious users can use shares approved by other users to withdraw assets.
