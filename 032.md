# Share manipulation in senior vault

## Summary
First users can manipulate share allocation to ensure next users receive less shares than due.

## Vulnerability Detail
By depositing into the senior vault a user can provide capital and gets shares of the total locked capital. The calculation of shares is pretty straightforward: 
    `shares=(totalSupply/totalAssets)`
where 
```solidity
function totalAssets() public view override(IERC4626, ERC4626Upgradeable) 
returns (uint256 amount) {
    amount = aUsdc.balanceOf(address(this));
    amount += totalUsdcBorrowed();
}
```
and totalSupply is the number of shares issued yet.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L370

so a malicious user can deposit some capital first, and then send aUsdc to the contract, which would modify the ratio used to convert deposit to shares.

When the ratio is very small, rounding errors become significant. If we take the example where the number of shares is `19`, and the total deposits amount to `10000` USDC, a new user depositing `1000` USDC will receive only `1` share, almost `50%` less than what he's due.

If enough deposits accumulate after this manipulation, the attacker shares are worth more than what he deposited (because next shares are truncated compared to deposits).

## Impact
Malicious users can manipulate share prices and withdraw other users funds.
