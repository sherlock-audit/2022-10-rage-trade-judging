# Junior and Senior vault can't handle slippage

## Summary
The ERC4626 contract doesn't have slippage checks built in. With time the ratio of assets to shares will increase. It won't be 1:1. Anybody who deposits or withdraws is at the risk of being sandwiched by MEV bots which will cause a loss of funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The user-facing functions to deposit and withdraw assets in the `DnGmxJuniorVault` and `DnGmxSeniorVault` contracts don't offer any slippage protection. Anybody using these functions through the public mempool is at the risk of being sandwiched. The ERC4626 standard doesn't have slippage checks built-in. Developers have to add it themselves. When Tribe initially launched the standard, they provided a router contract with slippage checks, see [here](https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626/blob/main/src/ERC4626RouterBase.sol#L20). 

## Impact
Any user depositing/withdrawing assets to/from the vault is at risk of being sandwiched. With the current scale of MEV, it's pretty likely that someone will pick up on this. Users will lose funds.

## Code Snippet
Vaults use standard ERC4626 function that have no slippage checks:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the user to pass a minimum value to `deposit()` and `redeem()` as well as a maximum value to `mint()` and `withdraw()`. On the client side, the deposit/withdrawal should be previewed using the respective functions and that value should be passed to the tx.
