# Vaults Could Be Left Without An Owner

## Summary

The vaults use `OwnableUpgradeable` from Open Zeppelin to manage ownership of each deployed vault. There's potential for the owner to accidentally renounce ownership and for the contracts to be left without an owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`DnGmxJuniorVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxJuniorVault.sol#L14)

[`DnGmxSeniorVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L11)

[`DnGmxBatchingManager`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-rage-trade/blob/main/dn-gmx-vaults/contracts/vaults/DnGmxBatchingManager.sol#L6)

These vaults all import  `OwnableUpgradeable`. This library has a [`renounceOwnership()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L66) function which if accidentally called by the owner will render the vault without ownership.

## Impact

- The owner could accidentally leave the contract without ownership.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
    _transferOwnership(address(0));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Override this function to prevent accidental contract ownership loss:

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public override onlyOwner {
    revert();
}
```
