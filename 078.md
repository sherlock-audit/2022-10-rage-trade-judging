# Attackers can manipulate ERC4626 price per share to take an unfair share of future users.

## Summary

Attackers can manipulate ERC4626 price per share to take an unfair share of future users because the protocol allows users to deposit a insignificant amount of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

Same issue like this: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-08-sentiment-judging#issue-h-1-a-malicious-early-userattacker-can-manipulate-the-ltokens-pricepershare-to-take-an-unfair-share-of-future-users-deposits

A malicious early user can deposit() with 1 wei of asset token and get 1 wei of shares. Then he/she can send 10000e18 - 1 of asset tokens and inflate the price per share from 1 to an extreme value of 1e22

```
(1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1 = 1e22
```


A future user who deposits 19999e18 will only receive 1 wei of shares token.

```
19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18 = 1
```

he/she would lose 9999e18 if they redeem() right after the deposit().

## Impact

The attacker can get funds from future users, and the future users will lose their funds.
